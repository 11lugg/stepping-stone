# [WIP] Stepping Stone - Ecommerce platform:

Deployed URL: https://jade-torte-d37df9.netlify.app/

This ecommerce platform has been designed to brush up on and showcase my current frontend skill level.

This is a React project with a list of dependencies below:

- React router dom
- SASS (initially used and subsequently transitioned to styled components due to styling conflicts)
- styled components
- Redux
- Redux Thunk (Async state management)
- Redux Persist (To persist state)
- Firebase (handling authentication and firestore database)

This isn't an exausted list. Please look at the package-lock.json file for all dependencies.

This is a work in progress and there is additional functionality being added. Please check back frequently to see its progress. Below is a roadmap of upcoming tasks. Here is a link to all my current commits https://github.com/11lugg/stepping-stone/commits/main:

- Migrating from Redux Thunk to Redux Saga to control the async actions more closely
- Adding stipe api to take payments for products
- Migrating the whole project to typescript. Typescript is something I work with in my current job role, as its becoming more prevalent in todays job market, it only makes sense to expand on my typescript knowledge
- Tidy up import ordering
- Go back and add performance optimizations throughout
- Making the site more responsive through use of media queries
- Converting it to a PWA
